//! Track event.
/*!
 *  A track event is analogous to a MIDI message.
 *
 *  The length of the event is defined with \ref on_time and \ref off_time.
 *
 *  There are multiple types of events. An event of type \ref REST can
 *  have an `off_time` only. \ref NOTE and \ref TIE events can have an
 *  `on_time` and `off_time`.
 *  The total length of the event is the sum of those lengths.
 *
 *  All other kinds of events are immediate and both the `on_time` and
 *  `off_time` must be 0.
